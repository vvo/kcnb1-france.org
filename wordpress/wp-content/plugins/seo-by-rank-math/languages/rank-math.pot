msgid "XML sitemaps are files that serve a single purpose - to help search engines find and index all of your content."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once upon a time, search engine bots would have a hard time finding all the content on a site. Many sites had a weak internal link structure, and that meant that some pages or posts would go overlooked."
msgstr ""

msgid "The early search engines gave us forms where we could enter our URLs one at a time. They'd feed this information into their queue of pages to crawl, and the pages would get visited and indexed at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typing in dozens or even hundreds of URLs was a tedious job - in fact, many companies popped up offering to submit your site to the search engines, because who had the time to do that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "When Google appeared on the scene, people soon noticed that submitting pages didn't lead to fast crawls. Linking to a page from another page (even on the same site) would get the bot to visit quickly."
msgstr ""

msgid "To solve the problem of getting pages crawled and indexed, many webmasters created a \"sitemap\". It was an ugly HTML page with nothing but links to all the site's content. It was a bit of an eyesore, and human users had little use for it. But it helped the spiders to find pages and it got them into the index."
msgstr ""

msgid "Search engines realized that people were building these pages that didn't do anything for human visitors, and they decided to cut us a break. They invented a new XML based file that we could use to communicate directly with the robots. We could announce our new pages without cluttering up our sites with pointless pages."
