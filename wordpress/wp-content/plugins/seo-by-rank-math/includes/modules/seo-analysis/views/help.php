<h3>SEO Analysis</h3>
<p>In this section, we're going to introduce the SEO analysis tool. As the name suggests, it analyzes your site's SEO and points out what you're doing right and the issues you need to fix.</p>

<p>Analyzing your SEO is the first step to making it perfect, so you should run this tool as your first step. It's a fast process, and it puts you on the right path.</p>

<p>You may have used SEO tools in the past - many of these tools check your page as you type and tell you if you're optimizing it properly. Rank Math does this too - but it does much more.</p>

<p>Checking a page as you type will detect "on-page" ranking factors - factors that influence the rankings for individual pages. But that only covers a single piece of the SEO puzzle. Although on-page factors are extremely important, there are other details that affect your site's rankings.</p>

<p>These include technical and performance issues, like caching, URL structure, and pagination.</p>

<p>Before you dig into every post and page on your site, you should fix any site-wide issues. But you have to identify them first - and that's where the analysis tool comes into play.</p>

<p>You have better things to do than spend hours poring over settings and working through checklists - that's why Rank Math has a built-in SEO Analysis tool. It scans your site in seconds and gives you a detailed breakdown of any issues it locates.</p>

<p>The tool also gives you instructions on how to fix each issue it finds - whether it's changing a setting or installing a simple plugin, you'll know what to do and how to do it.</p>
