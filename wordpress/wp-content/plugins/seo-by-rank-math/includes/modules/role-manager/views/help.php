<h3>Role Manager</h3>
<p>In this knowledge base article, we are going to discuss one of the most amazing features of Rank Math, the Role Manager.</p>

<p>You may have started your website alone, but as it grows, you will have to hire help or outsource certain tasks to keep your website growing. When you get more people working on your website, it poses a significant problem. You have to give them access to your backend. But as you probably understand, giving someone else full access to your website can lead to accidents, disasters, and frauds.</p>

<p>To prevent that from happening, we created the Role Manager in Rank Math. It’s an innovative feature that lets you restrict Rank Math’s individual features for each user, depending on what roles you give them on your website. If you didn’t understand that, do not worry. You will understand once we get into the details.</p>
