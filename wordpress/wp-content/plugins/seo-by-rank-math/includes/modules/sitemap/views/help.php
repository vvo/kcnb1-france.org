<h3>Sitemaps</h3>
<p>XML sitemaps are files that serve a single purpose - to help search engines find and index all of your content.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, search engine bots would have a hard time finding all the content on a site. Many sites had a weak internal link structure, and that meant that some pages or posts would go overlooked.</p>

<p>The early search engines gave us forms where we could enter our URLs one at a time. They'd feed this information into their queue of pages to crawl, and the pages would get visited and indexed at some point.</p>

<p>Typing in dozens or even hundreds of URLs was a tedious job - in fact, many companies popped up offering to submit your site to the search engines, because who had the time to do that?</p>

<p>When Google appeared on the scene, people soon noticed that submitting pages didn't lead to fast crawls. Linking to a page from another page (even on the same site) would get the bot to visit quickly.</p>

<p>To solve the problem of getting pages crawled and indexed, many webmasters created a "sitemap". It was an ugly HTML page with nothing but links to all the site's content. It was a bit of an eyesore, and human users had little use for it. But it helped the spiders to find pages and it got them into the index.</p>

<p>Search engines realized that people were building these pages that didn't do anything for human visitors, and they decided to cut us a break. They invented a new XML based file that we could use to communicate directly with the robots. We could announce our new pages without cluttering up our sites with pointless pages.</p>
