<h3>Redirections</h3>
<p>An HTTP redirection is a magical thing. When you visit a URL with a redirection, your browser automatically jumps to a new address.</p>

<p>You’ve seen this before with URL shortener services like bit.ly – instead of typing a long address, you type a short one. Your browser is automatically redirected to a different site, and it happens faster than you can blink.</p>

<p>HTTP redirections are powerful tools in SEO, and they have lots of other uses, too. You can read about why that’s a good idea in this article.</p>

<p>Rank Math makes it easy to set up HTTP redirects – in this article, we show you how.</p>
