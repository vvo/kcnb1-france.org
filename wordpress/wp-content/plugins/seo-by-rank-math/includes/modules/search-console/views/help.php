<h3>Search Console</h3>
<p>Google Search Console is a website management tool by Google. Specifically, it was created so that website owners can see important information about their websites and resolve issues related to search engines. Your Google Search Console account will contain important information such as your website’s index status, crawl or other issues, your search engines rankings and most importantly, the keywords that your website ranks for. This information comes directly from Google and is very accurate compared to any 3rd party tool.</p>

<p>Once you setup Rank Math to work with Google Search Console, then Rank Math can fetch important information like keyword ranking, craw errors etc from Search Console and display it right inside your WordPress admin. This saves you a lot of time and gives you actionable information to work with when creating new content.</p>
