<h3>AMP</h3>
<p>
	Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP for short, is a way for you to create fast loading pages that load blazing fast on mobile browsers. AMPs deliver consistent performance across multiple mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
	Because they work so well and help pages load fast, Google has come to love the AMP enabled websites over their counterparts when it comes to rankings in the SERPs.
</p>
<p>
	That is why having an AMP enabled website is so essential these days. But, having an AMP website brings its challenges with regards to the SEO. When you create AMPs, there are two versions of your site - one for the regular desktop browsers and one for the mobile browsers. If not handled properly, AMPs can backfire and create duplicate content issues which lead to de-ranked or worse, de-indexing of your posts.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully, we have thought this through and equipped Rank Math with the right tools to make sure your AMPS help your SEO, not ruin it.
</p>
