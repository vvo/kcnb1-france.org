<h3>Local SEO</h3>
<p>
	Local SEO is a way for you to rank better for searches made by your people in the area where you operate. It is the best way for you to get your products and services in front of the local customers.
</p>
<p>
	There are various methods for optimizing your website for local SEO but the easiest method is built right inside the Rank Math plugin.

<p>
	Simply <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="<?php KB::the( 'local-seo' ); ?>" target="_blank">setup your business as Local Business</a> during the setup wizard.
</p>
<p>
	Make sure the Local SEO & Google Knowledge Graph module is enabled.
