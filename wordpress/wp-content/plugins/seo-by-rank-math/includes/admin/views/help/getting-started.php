<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	Congratulations on installing Rank Math. We hope that you've had no issues with installing Rank Math on your website. After the installation, the next step is to run the setup wizard and configure Rank Math.
</p>
<p>
	While Rank Math automatically initiates the setup wizard once you install it, it is possible to skip it accidentally. If you’ve also skipped Rank Math’s setup wizard, then you can rerun the setup wizard by going to Rank Math’s dashboard, and then clicking the Setup Wizard tab.
